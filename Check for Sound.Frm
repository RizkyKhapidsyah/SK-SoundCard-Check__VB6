'Please use this project and all of its source code however you want.
'
'UNZIPPING
'To unzip the project files you will need a 32Bit unzipper program that
'can handle long file names. If you have a latest copy of Winzip installed
'on your system then you may use that. If you however dont have a copy,
'then visit my web site, go into the files section and from there you can
'click on the Winzip link to goto their site and download a copy of the
'program. By doing this you will now beable to unzip the project files
'retaining their proper long file names.
'Once upzipped, load up your copy of Visual Basic and goto
'File/Open Project. Locate the project files to where ever you unzipped
'them, then click Open. The project files will be loaded and are now ready
'for use.
'
'THE PROJECT
'If your making a program to use Windows sound functions, then first of all
'your going to need to know whether or not the user using your application
'has a sound card installed. To do this it is quite simple. A function to
'the API can tell you whether the system has a sound card installed or not.
'It requires little code to do this, so makes it very simple.
'
'NOTES
'I have only provided the necessary project files with the zip. This keeps
'the size of the zip files down to a minimum and enables me to upload more
'prjects files to my site.
'
'I hope you find the project usful in what ever you are programming. I
'have tried to write out a small explanation of what each line of code
'does in the project, although most of it is pretty simple to understand.
'
'If you find any bugs in the code then please dont hesitate to Email me and
'I will get back to you as soon as possible. If you however need help on a
'different matter concerning Visual Basic then please please Email me as
'I like to here from people and here what they are programming.
